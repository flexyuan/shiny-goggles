    {code: "bRIW", type: "Runner", bestPlacement: "Any", description: "The goal at the beginning is just to survive. And it's not easy. The first spiral gives the most brutal bumps in the entire game. Not even 1st is safe. Otherwise, the track has pretty unintuitive lines so be sure to watch the NITA WR for tips on those."},
    {code: "bBC3", type: "Shroomer", bestPlacement: "Bottom 4", description: "To get to the front you usually need 2 shrooms as the first cut doesn't save too much time. However, after the 2nd dirt cut the track is great to get huge breakaways. Beware of the fire pillar on the left side on lap 2 if you're on good pace and on lap 3 if you're on poor pace."},
    {code: "bRRw", type: "Drafter", bestPlacement: "4-7", description: "One of the best tracks to be in 1st in the entire game. Blues and shocks are often nerfed due to how much halfpipes, boost panels, and gliders cover the track. There will often be multiple blues and shocks with how long the track is so plan accordingly."},
